        <h1 class="how-to-h1">1. Pig!</h1>
        <p>
            To play pig, Roll the dice and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t 
            roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.
        </p>
        <p>
            Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first player to accumulate 100 points wins the game.
        </p>
        
        <h1 class="how-to-h1">2. Beat That!</h1>
        <p>
            To play Beat That, Roll the dice and put them in order to make the highest number possible. If you roll a 4 and a 6, for example, 
            your best answer would be a 64. Ten rounds of Knock Out are played. At the end of the ten rounds, the player with the highest remaining score is the winner.
        </p>
        
        <h1 class="how-to-h1">3. Knock Out!</h1>
        <p>
            To play Knock Out, every player rolls two dice. 
            The dice are then added together. That sum is the score unless it was a 7. 
            When a sum of seven is rolled, not only does the player not score for that round, 
            but all of the players scores up to that point are knocked out leaving a score of 0. 
            That player will have to start over again at 0.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ten rounds of Knock Out are played. At the end of the ten rounds, the player with the highest remaining score is the winner.
