In this project there three dice games.

### 1. PIG
**Pig** is a simple dice game. Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.  

Even though the directions make this game sound easy, unless you are good at throwing 1s, this game may be hard for to play. The game is called “Pig” because the first player “hogs” the dice in an effort to win the game.  

**Dice need:** 1  

**Object of the game:** To score 100 points  

#### How to play PIG
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
* The first player to score 100 points wins.

### 2. Beat That!

### 3. Knock Out!
Knock Out is another easy dice game that needs only two dice.  

**Dice need:** 2  

**Object of the game:** To score highest at the end of 10 rounds. 

#### How to play knock out 
To play Knock Out, every player rolls two dice. The dice are then added together. That sum is the score unless it was a 7. When a sum of seven is rolled, not only does the player not score for that round, but all of the players scores up to that point are knocked out leaving a score of 0.  

That player will have to start over again at 0.
